# Clarity-PHP
PHP code to use the Clarity LIMS API

## Description
This code should make it easier to use the Clarity API, 
which is based on retrieving or submitting XML with HTTP requests. 
Here the idea is to get the XML and use it to create an object corresponding 
to a resource. Modifying an object is easier than to manipulate XML data. 
Then when the object has the right values for its properties, 
change it back to XML ready to be submitted. 
A new object can also be created to submit a new resource to Clarity. 
And because this code is PHP, it should be easy to integrate with PHP-based 
websites, built with the Symfony framework for instance.
